# Overview
I wrote a game on C# where the player has to fall through platforms to stay alive. If they hit the top of the screen then they die and the game is over.

# Development Environment

I developed the code in Visual Studio code. I used C# and relied on the Raylib library

# Future Work
- Add friction to the game so that the player doesn't stop abruptly instead they slowly glide to a stop
- Add a power up that temporarily makes the player intangible so that they can fall through the platforms easily
